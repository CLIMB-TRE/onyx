# Onyx

## Overview

Onyx is a Django-based API for managing metadata records, analyses, and other associated data. It provides a flexible system for handling projects of varying metadata requirements, with built-in access control, data validation, sensitive identifier anonymisation, and a granular query system.

As part of [CLIMB-TRE](https://climb-tre.github.io/), Onyx serves as the central metadata repository for the following projects:

- [mSCAPE](https://mscape.climb.ac.uk/) (Metagenomics Surveillance Collaboration and Analysis Programme): A collaborative initiative led by UKHSA, involving a consortium of NHS and academic partners, to deliver a pilot surveillance network trialling the use of metagenomic data for public health surveillance and pathogen analysis.
- [PATH-SAFE](https://www.food.gov.uk/our-work/pathogen-surveillance-in-agriculture-food-and-environment-path-safe-programme) (Pathogen Surveillance in Agriculture, Food and Environment): Led by the FSA, PATH-SAFE piloted the development of a national surveillance network to improve the detection and tracking of foodborne human pathogens and AMR within agriculture.
- [synthSCAPE](https://climb-tre.github.io/synthscape/) (Synthetic dataset for mSCAPE)
- [openMGS](https://climb-tre.github.io/openmgs/) (Open Meta-Genomic Surveillance)
