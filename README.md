# Onyx

## Overview

Onyx is a Django-based API for managing metadata records, analyses, and associated data. It provides a flexible system for handling projects with varying metadata requirements, with built-in access control, data validation and anonymisation, and a granular query system.

As part of [CLIMB-TRE](https://climb-tre.github.io/), Onyx serves as the central metadata storage for the following projects:

- [mSCAPE](https://mscape.climb.ac.uk/): The Metagenomics Surveillance Collaboration and Analysis Programme
- [PATH-SAFE](https://www.food.gov.uk/our-work/pathogen-surveillance-in-agriculture-food-and-environment-path-safe-programme): The Pathogen Surveillance in Agriculture, Food and Environment Programme
