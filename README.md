# Onyx

## Overview

Onyx is a Django-based API for managing metadata records, analyses, and other associated data. It provides a flexible system for handling projects of varying metadata requirements, with built-in access control, data validation, sensitive identifier anonymisation, and a granular query system.

As part of [CLIMB-TRE](https://climb-tre.github.io/), Onyx serves as the central metadata repository for the following projects:

- [mSCAPE](https://mscape.climb.ac.uk/): Metagenomics Surveillance Collaboration and Analysis Programme
- [PATH-SAFE](https://www.food.gov.uk/our-work/pathogen-surveillance-in-agriculture-food-and-environment-path-safe-programme): Pathogen Surveillance in Agriculture, Food and Environment Programme
- [synthSCAPE](https://climb-tre.github.io/synthscape/): Synthetic dataset for mSCAPE
- [openMGS](https://climb-tre.github.io/openmgs/): Open Meta-Genomic Surveillance
